### Workout tracker

This is a nodejs app to keep track of your workouts.  It consists of two parts, the client and the server.

#### Client

This is the nodejs instance (which runs on port 8081) that acts as a front-end interface to the server.  It allows viewing and modifying of the data.

#### Server

This runs on port 8080, and is responsible for handling HTTP request and updating the mongodb instance accordingly.
